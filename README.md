# tickertracker.
Developed a stock price display device using an API to show real-time and historical stock data with customisable time ranges. Developing my skills in API integration, real-time data handling and front-end design for quant finance applications.

the time ranges I decided on: last 24 hours last 7 days last 30 days year to date all avaliable data since 2016

Search functionality allowing for search an display data for a specific ticker symbols

Multi-ticker tracking allows for up to 30 ticker symbols simultaneously

User interface, offers an intuitive interface featuring a search bar, buttons for selecting different time ranges and a clean display of the stock price data

Technologies that i used for this project are: Python Alpaca API HTML/CSS for the front-end while still deciding whether to integrate Python GUI libraries which would be more of a learning curve as I've had experience in HTML and CSS via website development

Future enhancements will be: Adding live subscription based updates to allow for real-time data without delays improve scalability so allowing more ticker symbols to be tracked Allow for interactive charts and graphs Expand functionality by aiming to integrate cryptocurrency tracking into the device
